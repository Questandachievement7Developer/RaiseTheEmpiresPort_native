## How to Install?
### Installing on Android using Termux
1. Install Puffin Browser from the Play Store.
2. Download the latest version of Termux from [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases).
3. Copy and paste the following command into Termux (You only need to do this once):
   ```bash
   pkg install git wget python -y
   pkg update
   pkg install libxml2 libxslt -y
   pkg install dropbear -y
   pkg install openssh -y
   git clone https://github.com/AcidCaos/raisetheempires
   pip install "git+https://github.com/hex-in/libscrc.git"
   pip install tendo py3amf "flask<2.1.0" flask_session flask_sqlalchemy flask_compress flask_socketio daiquiri python-editor xmldiff jsonpatch tqdm
   ```
4. Press Enter to run the command.
5. If there's a confirmation [Y/n], type Y.
6. If there are several confirmations [Y/I/N/O/D/Z], type Y.
7. Wait until the installation is completed (and ensure your internet connection is stable).

Then use this command every time you want to play:
   ```bash
   cd raisetheempires
   python empires-server.py --no-popup --no-crash-log --port 5005
   ```
   Press Enter to run the command.

After that, swipe left on Termux and tap the 'New Session' option. Copy this command to start hosting on a public link:
   ```bash
   ssh -R 80:localhost:5005 nokey@localhost.run
   ```
   Press Enter to run the command. If there's a confirmation [yes/no], type yes. Copy the generated link into Puffin Browser.

*Done*

### Installing on GNU/Linux/Ubuntu
1. Assuming you have the terminal opened.
2. Copy and paste this command into the terminal (You only need to do this once):
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
   git clone https://github.com/AcidCaos/raisetheempires
   cd raisetheempires
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Then use this command every time you want to play:
   ```bash
   python3 empires-server.py --no-popup --no-crash-log --port 5005
   ```
   You need to use a Flash-enabled browser, then go to this URL: http://127.0.0.1:5005

*Optional*: If you want to host online on a public link, open a new terminal window and use this command:

   ```
   If there's confirmation [yes/no], type yes.

*Done*
